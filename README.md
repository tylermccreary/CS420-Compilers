CS420-Compilers
===============
This is a compiler I wrote for my Compilers class.  It takes in a text file consisting of a made-up programmaing language called TruPL.  It will then parse the code and generate code for TrAL (a made-up assembly language).
To compile: make truc
To run: ./truc <file name>
